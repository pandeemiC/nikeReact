# A Mock Nike Website

**Nike** is a modern looking, simple site that is made for practice purposes only. It's functionality only lies with the practice of State Management, with a sprinkle of useEffect. As much as it was for practice purposes, it's a fun project that changes themes and contents depending the shoe clicked on the thumbnails.
